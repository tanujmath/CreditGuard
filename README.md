Team Participants: Tushar Pandey, Soumya Ganguly, Tanuj Gupta, Aravind P Ravi and Ankur Roy.


This project was created as part of the requirement for the Erdos Data Science Fall Bootcamp 2023. The project named 'CreditGuard' aims to use the wealth of historical financial data for credit card customers to apply supervised Machine Learning methods to predict the delinquency threat for new creditors. The various models used show us their respective efficiencies in predicting the risk of delinquency for prospective customers.

This provides a real-life predictive algorithm for financial institutions and secures investors from the risk of defaulting. Apart from suggesting the best-optimized model to predict the outcomes, our code also provides a personalized recommendation for each individual outlining the financial parameters and guidelines that one should work on to reverse his chances of defaulting.

Further, the model outputs a definite score signifying the creditworthiness of a person thus providing transparency as well as a reference measure to build on and compare against.
